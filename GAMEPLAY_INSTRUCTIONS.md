2. Explain the investigation rules
3. Set up the ghost mechanic

**Host Script:**

> "Here are some critical facts about what just happened:"

**Your Tasks:**

> *"All the lights in the house glowing bright,*
> *except one that lost its light.*
> *Seek the place where darkness dwells,*
> *there the Crystal's magic spells."*

**Guide players:**
- They need to find a light that's not working
- You should have prepared this beforehand (turned off light, removed bulb, etc.)
- Place your "crystal" prop near that light
- Let players search and find it

**Once found:**
> "Excellent! You've found the Ghost Crystal. Here's how it works:"
>
> "1. Only ONE person can hold the crystal at a time"
> "2. That person can ask the Ghost ONE yes/no question"
> "3. The question CANNOT be direct like 'Is Player 5 the killer?'"
> "4. It must be indirect like 'Is the killer someone with poison knowledge?'"
> "5. The Ghost will point to his HEAD for YES, or point to the TV for NO"
> "6. After the answer, pass the crystal to someone else"
> "7. The Ghost can also point at people or objects to give hints"

---

### PHASE 7: INVESTIGATION PHASE (60-90 minutes)

**Your Tasks:**
1. Keep the investigation moving
2. Reveal clues at appropriate times
3. Ensure everyone participates
4. Take notes on accusations

**Structure:**

**ROUND 1: Initial Alibis (15-20 min)**

> "Let's start by having everyone share: WHERE WERE YOU when the lights went out?"

Go around the room. Each player shares their alibi. Take notes!

Alibis to expect:
- P2: At the table
- P3: On phone with lawyer (P7)
- P4: In bathroom washing hands
- P5: Outside taking a call
- P6: In kitchen examining Timur oil
- P7: Outside on phone with P3
- P8: Checking online board meeting
- P9: Live-streaming (but stream doesn't show table)
- P10: On computer
- P11: At the table
- P12: **In kitchen** (SUSPICIOUS!)
- P13: Chatting with AI on phone

**After alibis, encourage discussion:**
> "Interesting. Some of you have witnesses, some don't. Let's discuss what we've learned."

**ROUND 2: Motives (15-20 min)**

> "Now let's discuss: Who had a MOTIVE to kill the Momo King?"

Go around again. Players should share why they were angry at the victim.

Watch for:
- Business betrayals
- Stolen ideas
- Refused payments
- Relationship issues

**CLUE REVEAL #1: Ghost Crystal Questions (Ongoing)**

Throughout the investigation, players will use the Ghost Crystal. As Player 1 (Ghost), you need to help them:

Sample questions players might ask:
- "Is the killer someone who was in the kitchen?" → HEAD (yes)
- "Is the killer someone with scientific knowledge?" → TV (no)
- "Does the killer have a personal motive?" → HEAD (yes)
- "Is the killer a man?" → TV (no)

**CLUE REVEAL #2: Autopsy Report (After 30 minutes)**

> "Everyone, I have the autopsy report back from the coroner. Listen carefully:"
>
> *"The victim was poisoned with a rare and potent toxin derived from the Aconitum plant, commonly known as monkshood or wolfsbane. This toxin is highly lethal even in small doses and can cause severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cardiac arrest.*
>
> *The poison was likely administered through ingestion, suggesting that it was mixed into the victim's food or drink.*
>
> *Given the nature of the toxin, it is crucial to identify who had access to the victim's meal and the means to obtain such a substance."*

**After reading:**
> "So we're looking for someone who:
> 1. Had access to the Momo King's food
> 2. Could obtain this rare poison
> 3. Knew how to use it"

**ROUND 3: Means & Opportunity (20-30 min)**

Now the real investigation heats up. Players should:
- Point out who was in the kitchen (P6, P12)
- Discuss who has poison knowledge (P4, P5, P6)
- Note P2 added Timur (suspicious!)
- Note P9 brought toxic chili oil (suspicious!)
- Discuss weak alibis

**Facilitate discussion:**
> "I'm hearing several suspicious facts emerging. Let's break this down:"
> "Who had ACCESS to the food?"
> "Who has KNOWLEDGE of poisons?"
> "Who has the weakest ALIBI?"

**CLUE REVEAL #3: Evidence Witnesses (As Needed)**

If players aren't bringing up key evidence, prompt them:

> "Wait, didn't someone see Player 2 adding something to the food?"
> → P6 should reveal they saw P2 adding Timur

> "And didn't someone bring actual toxic substance to the party?"
> → P2 should accuse P9 of bringing toxic chili oil

**CLUE REVEAL #4: Tech Guy Hacks Computer (After 45 min)**

> "Wait, Player 10 is saying they've hacked into the Momo King's laptop and found something!"

**Read this text message conversation:**
> "Unknown Contact: 'Are you sure about this? All I want is us to be together in business or not.'
> Momo King: 'I can't just leave everything behind. The business is my life.'"

> "This suggests the Momo King was having some kind of personal relationship conflict. Who could this 'unknown contact' be?"

This should raise suspicion about:
- P11 (having affair with P1)
- P12 (P1's wife, knew about problems)
- Marital issues

**ROUND 4: Final Arguments (15-20 min)**

> "We're getting close to making accusations. Let's hear final arguments. If you're accused of something, now's your chance to defend yourself!"

Watch for:
- P12 should be acting dramatically, crying, accusing others
- P11 should be trying to protect P3 and hide the affair
- P6 might reveal P10 asked about poisons
- P10 might point finger at P6
- P2 and P9 accusing each other

**Key moment:** If someone accuses P12 of being in the kitchen:
- P12 should deflect HARD
- Accuse P3 or P11
- Get emotional
- Try to frame them for business/jealousy motive

---

### PHASE 8: ACCUSATION PHASE (15-20 minutes)

**Your Tasks:**
1. Call for formal accusations
2. Have each player present their case
3. Facilitate voting
4. Tally votes

**What to Say:**
> "The time has come to make your accusations. Each of you will have a chance to state who you believe is the killer and why. Then we'll vote."

**Go around the room:**
> "[Player Name], who do you accuse and why?"

Each player presents their case (1-2 minutes each).

**After all accusations:**
> "Now it's time to vote. On the count of three, everyone point to the person you believe is the killer."
>
> "One... two... three... POINT!"

**Count the votes and announce:**
> "The player with the most votes is... [Player Name]! You have been accused of murdering the Momo King."

---

### PHASE 9: THE REVEAL (5-10 minutes)

**Your Tasks:**
1. Build dramatic tension
2. Reveal the true killer
3. Let the killer explain
4. Congratulate winners

**What to Say:**
> "Before we find out if you're correct, let me reveal what REALLY happened..."

**Ask Player 12 to read their "Secret" section aloud.**

Player 12 reveals:
- They are the killer
- They used sedative from friend's medicine cabinet
- Applied it during the blackout
- Motive: husband was cheating and going to leave them

**Then announce:**
> "The TRUE killer was... **Player 12, the Momo King's Wife!**"

**If the group voted correctly:**
> "Congratulations! You successfully identified the killer! Justice has been served!"

**If the group voted incorrectly:**
> "Unfortunately, you accused the wrong person. Player 12 has gotten away with murder... for now. Better luck next time, detectives!"

**Wrap up:**
> "Let's give a round of applause to everyone for playing! Special recognition to:"
> - Player 12 for being a convincing killer
> - Player 1 for the dramatic death scene
> - [Any player who was particularly clever or entertaining]

## Investigation Phase Guide

### FOR HOSTS: Managing the Investigation

#### Keep Things Moving

**If discussion stalls:**
- "Let's focus on alibis. Who DOESN'T have a solid alibi?"
- "Has anyone noticed any contradictions?"
- "Ghost, can you give us a hint?" (have P1 point at something)

**If one player is too quiet:**
- "[Player Name], you've been very quiet. What do you think about [recent accusation]?"
- "Player 7, as the Legal Advisor, what's your take on this?"

**If players are stuck:**
- Reveal the next clue early
- Have the Ghost become more animated
- Prompt specific players to reveal information

**If accusations get too heated:**
- "Remember, stay in character everyone!"
- "Let's hear their defense before we jump to conclusions"
- "Back up your accusations with evidence"

#### Clue Timing Guidelines

Release clues based on progress, not strict time:

**Autopsy Report:** When players have discussed motives
**Sleeping Pill Clue:** When players focus too much on scientific poisons
**Text Messages:** When players aren't considering relationship issues
**Witness Statements:** When key evidence isn't emerging

#### Managing Special Characters

**Player 1 (Ghost):**
- They should be having fun with gestures
- Encourage dramatic pointing
- They can react to accusations (shake head, nod, point)

**Player 12 (Killer):**
- Should be VERY dramatic
- Crying, accusing others, emotional
- If cornered about kitchen visit, deflects immediately

**Player 7 (Legal Advisor):**
- Should be leading investigation
- Asking questions like a lawyer
- Help them if they're not taking charge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Players are reading their secrets aloud**
- Solution: "Stop! That section is for your eyes only. Don't reveal your secret unless caught!"

**Issue: Players aren't participating**
- Solution: Direct questions to quiet players: "Player X, what do you think about this accusation?"

**Issue: Discussion is going in circles**
- Solution: Introduce the next clue or refocus: "Let's move on to discussing means. Who had access to poison?"

**Issue: Players are making random accusations without evidence**
- Solution: "In character, what evidence do you have? Your character wouldn't randomly accuse someone."

**Issue: Someone figured it out too quickly**
- Solution: Don't confirm! Let them try to convince others. The fun is in the debate!

**Issue: Players are being too aggressive/personal**
- Solution: "Remember, this is your CHARACTER accusing, not you personally. Keep it fun!"

**Issue: The Ghost (P1) is answering questions incorrectly**
- Solution: Have a cheat sheet showing P12 is the killer. Before game, brief P1 on key answers.

**Issue: Technical problems with devices**
- Solution: Have printed backup character sheets ready

**Issue: Players keep looking at each other's screens**
- Solution: "No peeking! Keep your devices private or the mystery is ruined!"

**Issue: Game is running too long**
- Solution: "We have 15 minutes left, let's start final accusations"

**Issue: Game is going too fast**
- Solution: Add more discussion rounds, slow down clue reveals
