## OPENING STATEMENT FOR THE HOST

**[Read this aloud to set the scene]**

"Everyone is gathered around in the cozy living room of a contemporary suburban home. The house is lit in Christmas spirit—a tall white Christmas tree stands in the corner of the living room, decorated with ornaments and twinkling lights. The aroma of various holiday dishes fills the air, and the sound of cheerful Christmas music plays softly in the background.

Today it's not just any Christmas dinner—it's also a celebration party for one of the guests who is rumored to have perfected the 'Best Momo of All Time' recipe and is starting a business selling it. Everyone is excited to try the dish. If there is one thing that unites this group of people, it's their love for momos.

Everyone starts by grabbing a plate with one momo each and sitting down to enjoy the meal together."

**[Have everyone mime getting a plate and sitting down]**

---

## CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS

**[Say this before introductions begin]**

"Before we eat, let's have everyone introduce themselves. When I call on you, please read your 'About You' section aloud so everyone knows who you are and why you're here tonight."

**[Call on each player P2-P13 first, THEN P1 last]**

"Let's start with [Player Name]. Please tell us about your character."

**[After everyone else has introduced themselves]**

"Wonderful! Now we all know each other. And finally, let's hear from our host tonight—the Momo King!"

**[Player 1 reads their "About You" section]**

---

## THE TOAST & MURDER

**[After P1's introduction, say]**

"The Momo King stands up and wants to make a toast before everyone eats."

**[Player 1 should now read their TOAST SCRIPT from their character sheet - let them finish the entire toast]**

**[Player 1 will:]**
- Give dramatic speech about their genius
- Thank everyone condescendingly
- Raise their glass
- Take a large bite of the momo

**[IMMEDIATELY after P1 takes the bite, you say loudly:]**

"The lights flicker..."

**[Optional: Turn off lights briefly or have someone dim them]**

"...and when they come back on..."

**[Player 1 now performs DEATH SCENE:]**
- Grabs throat
- Yells "THE CHUTNEY... IT BURNS!"
- Collapses dramatically to the floor

**[You announce dramatically:]**

"Everyone gasps in horror as the Momo King collapses to the ground! You rush to help, but...

[Pause for effect]

...it's too late. He's dead."

---

## THE PLOT STARTS - WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

**[For your reference only - don't read this aloud yet]**

While everyone was watching or distracted during the toast, the lights flickered and went off for a few seconds. During this brief blackout, Player 12 (The Momo King's Wife) quickly applied the sedative poison to her husband's momo. She had been planning this and waiting for the right moment.

When the lights came back on, the Momo King took a bite of his poisoned momo and immediately began to choke. Within moments, he collapsed. The guests are now in shock and confusion.

**[Now read this aloud to the players:]**

"The guests are now in shock and confusion. As your host for this investigation, I must inform you: no one is allowed to leave until we find out who did this. We must work together to solve the mystery of who killed the Momo King and why."

---

## HOST ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE POISONING

**[Read this aloud to all players]**

"What has just happened is a tragedy. The Momo King has been poisoned. As your host for this investigation, it is my duty to ensure that we find out who is responsible for this heinous act.

Here are some important details to keep in mind as we begin our investigation:

**FACT 1:** Everyone had the same momo. The poison must have been in the Momo King's momo ONLY.

**FACT 2:** Only ONE momo was poisoned—the Momo King's momo. Someone must have tampered with ONLY his momo specifically.

**FACT 3:** Everyone here had a motive to kill the Momo King. The goal is to find out who did it before the night is over.

Everyone here has something to gain or lose from the Momo King's death. It is up to us to uncover the truth and bring the culprit to justice.

But wait... something strange is happening..."

**[Player 1 should now stand up]**

"The Momo King is rising... as THE GHOST OF MOMOS PAST!"

---

## INTRODUCING THE GHOST

**[Read this aloud]**

"The Ghost of Momos Past cannot speak or make any audible sounds. However, when someone holds the magical Ghost Crystal, they can ask him YES or NO questions!

But first... we need to FIND that crystal. Let the investigation begin!"

---

## CLUE #1: THE GHOST CRYSTAL (Reveal at 15 minutes)

**[Read this riddle aloud]**

"Work collectively to solve this riddle to find the magic Crystal that will help you communicate with the Ghost of Momos Past:

*'All the lights in the house glowing bright,*
*except one that lost its light.*
*Seek the place where darkness dwells,*
*there the Crystal's magic spells.'*"

**[Host Notes:]**
- You should have prepared this beforehand (turned off a light, removed bulb, etc.)
- Place your crystal prop near that light
- Let players search and find it
- Takes about 5-10 minutes

**[Once found, read these rules aloud:]**

"Excellent! You've found the Ghost Crystal! Here's how it works:

1. Only ONE person can hold the crystal at a time
2. That person can ask the Ghost ONE yes/no question
3. The question CANNOT be direct like 'Is Player 5 the killer?'
4. It must be indirect like 'Is the killer someone with poison knowledge?'
5. The Ghost will point to his HEAD for YES
6. The Ghost will point to the TV for NO
7. After the answer, pass the crystal to someone else
8. The Ghost can also point at people or objects to give hints

Remember Ghost (Player 1): You cannot speak! Only point!"

**[Sample Questions & Answers for Ghost (Player 1):]**
- "Is the killer someone who was in the kitchen?" - **HEAD (YES)** - P12 was in kitchen
- "Is the killer a man?" - **TV (NO)** - P12 is a woman
- "Does the killer have scientific knowledge?" - **TV (NO)** - P12 is not a scientist
- "Is the killer someone with a personal motive?" - **HEAD (YES)** - Relationship motive
- "Was the poison something exotic?" - **TV (NO)** - It was sleeping pills

---

## CLUE #2: AUTOPSY REPORT (Reveal at 30 minutes)

**[Read this aloud dramatically]**

"Everyone, I have the autopsy report back from the coroner. Listen carefully:

*'The victim was poisoned with a rare and potent toxin derived from the Aconitum plant, commonly known as monkshood or wolfsbane. This toxin is highly lethal even in small doses and can cause severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cardiac arrest.*

*The poison was likely administered through ingestion, suggesting that it was mixed into the victim's food or drink.*

*Given the nature of the toxin, it is crucial to identify who had access to the victim's meal and the means to obtain such a substance.'*

So we're looking for someone who:
1. Had access to the Momo King's food
2. Could obtain this rare poison
3. Knew how to use it"

**[Host Note:]** This should focus discussion on who has poison knowledge (P4, P5, P6) and who had access to the food (P6, P12 in kitchen; P2 added Timur)

---

## CLUE #3: SLEEPING PILL CONNECTION (Reveal if needed - around 40 minutes)

**[Use this if players are too focused on exotic poisons]**

**[Read aloud:]**

"Wait! Player 6, the Chemist, is examining the symptoms more carefully and has made a discovery!"

**[Have Player 6 say, or you say for them:]**

"Actually, looking at the symptoms and the way the poison acted... these match the effects of a powerful sedative. Like sleeping pills, but in a lethal dose. This wasn't some exotic plant poison—it was something much more accessible. A common medication, concentrated and applied to the food."

**[You continue:]**

"So the killer didn't need access to rare botanical poisons. They just needed sleeping pills. Who among us could have accessed sleeping pills?"

**[Host Note:]** This should shift focus away from the scientists (P4, P5, P6) who everyone suspects, and toward someone with regular access to medications. P12 stole them from a friend's medicine cabinet.

---

## CLUE #4: TEXT MESSAGES FROM LAPTOP (Reveal at 45 minutes)

**[Say this:]**

"Wait! Player 10, the Tech Guy, has been working on hacking into the Momo King's laptop. Player 10, what have you found?"

**[Have Player 10 announce they've successfully hacked in, or you announce for them]**

**[Read these text messages aloud:]**

"The Tech Guy has found a text message conversation between the Momo King and an unknown contact:

**Unknown Contact:** 'Are you sure about this? All I want is us to be together in business or not'

**Momo King:** 'I can't just leave everything behind. The business is my life.'

**Unknown Contact:** 'Then I guess we know where we stand. You've made your choice.'

**Momo King:** 'Don't be like that. Let's talk about this later.'

**[You continue:]**

"This suggests the Momo King was having some kind of personal relationship conflict. Someone wanted to be with him, but he was choosing his business over them. Who could this 'unknown contact' be?"

**[Host Note:]** This should raise suspicion about:
- P11 (Rival Chef's Wife) - having affair with P1
- P12 (Momo King's Wife) - knew about marital problems
- Relationship/personal motives vs business motives

---

## ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE (Use if needed)

### If P6 (Chemist) Isn't Bringing It Up:

**[Prompt them:]** "Player 6, you were in the kitchen examining the Timur oil. Did you see anything unusual?"

**[P6 should reveal:]** They saw P2 adding Timur to P1's plate (red herring)

### If P2 (Food Fanatic) Isn't Bringing It Up:

**[Prompt them:]** "Player 2, you seem suspicious of Player 9. Why?"

**[P2 should reveal:]** P9 brought toxic chili oil to the party (red herring)

### If Players Miss the Affair Angle:

**[You can have P7 or P9 reveal:]**
- P7: "The Momo King asked me about divorce settlements recently"
- P9: "My follower told me they saw the Momo King with someone's wife"

### If P13 (AI Developer) Hasn't Mentioned It:

**[Prompt them:]** "Player 13, didn't Player 12 ask you some strange questions recently?"

**[P13 should reveal:]** P12 asked about how to make ChatGPT give dangerous information

---

## ACCUSATION PHASE (After 60-90 minutes of investigation)

**[When you're ready to wrap up, announce:]**

"The time has come to make your final accusations. Each of you will have a chance to state who you believe is the killer and why. Then we'll vote.

Remember: Present your EVIDENCE. Don't just guess!"

**[Go around the room:]**

"[Player Name], who do you accuse and why? You have up to 2 minutes."

**[Let each player present their case]**

**[After all accusations, build tension:]**

"Now it's time to vote. This is your one chance to identify the killer and bring them to justice.

On the count of three, everyone point to the person you believe murdered the Momo King.

Remember: You're voting based on the evidence you've gathered!

One...

Two...

Three...

POINT!"

**[Count the votes out loud]**

"Let me tally the votes:
- Player X: [count] votes
- Player Y: [count] votes
..."

**[Announce the result:]**

"The player with the most votes is... **[Player Name]**!

You have been accused of murdering the Momo King."

---

## THE REVEAL

**[Build dramatic tension:]**

"Before we find out if you're correct, let me tell you what REALLY happened that night..."

**[Pause dramatically]**

"Player 12... The Momo King's Wife... would you like to reveal your secret?"

**[Have Player 12 read their "Secret" section aloud, or summarize for them:]**

"Player 12 reveals: 'I AM THE KILLER. I poisoned the Momo King with a powerful sedative that I stole from a friend's medicine cabinet. I applied it to his momo during the brief power blackout. My motive was pure, personal vengeance. My husband was having an affair with Player 11. He was going to leave me after we struggled together for so long. Just when things were getting good, he was going to abandon me and enjoy the fortune with someone else. I couldn't let that happen.'"

**[Then announce dramatically:]**

"The TRUE killer was... **PLAYER 12, THE MOMO KING'S WIFE!**"

**[Pause for reactions]**

---

## WINNER ANNOUNCEMENT

### If the group voted correctly (accused P12):

**[Say enthusiastically:]**

"CONGRATULATIONS! You successfully identified the killer! Justice has been served! The Momo King's Wife will face the consequences of her actions. You are all brilliant detectives!"

**[Lead applause]**

### If the group voted incorrectly:

**[Say dramatically:]**

"Unfortunately, you accused the wrong person. [Accused Player] is innocent!

Player 12, the Momo King's Wife, has gotten away with murder... for now.

She will continue to live free, while an innocent person nearly took the blame.

Better luck next time, detectives!"

---

## WRAP-UP & DEBRIEF

**[After the reveal, facilitate discussion:]**

"Let's take a moment to discuss what happened.

**To Player 12 (the killer):** How did it feel playing the killer? What was your strategy?

**To the group:** What clues did you catch? What did you miss?

**To Player 1 (the Ghost):** How was being dead and unable to speak?

**To the accused innocent player (if applicable):** How did it feel being accused when you were innocent?"

**[Give recognition:]**

"Let's give a round of applause to:
- **Player 12** for being a convincing killer and keeping the secret!
- **Player 1** for the dramatic death scene and helpful ghostly hints!
- **Player 7** (if they played well) for leading the investigation!
- **[Any player]** for particularly clever deductions or entertaining roleplay!"

**[Final words:]**

"Thank you all for playing Momo Massacre! I hope you had as much fun as I did hosting.

Remember: In murder mystery, it's not about winning—it's about the journey, the drama, and the fun of solving the puzzle together!

Great game, everyone!"
