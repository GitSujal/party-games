    "description": "Wealthy investor who was betrayed when the Momo King tried to secure funds from multiple investors behind his back.",
    "about": "I am **The Investor**! 💵 The Momo King came to me first, pitching his 'Best Momo of all Time' as a brilliant, unique opportunity. I was initially very excited! But recently, I found out the absolute truth: he was trying to secure funds from multiple investors behind my back, using my name and reputation to make them trust him, even though I hadn't signed anything! He was planning to collect all the money and **cut me out of the deal completely**! I feel betrayed and used. He thought he could use my influence and money and then discard me. I demand a seat at the table, or there is no business at all!",
    "secret": "I have the money and resources to hire people to do 'dirty work' for me. In the past, I have certainly used my financial influence to get what I wanted through force and intimidation. Someone recently saw me threatening the Momo King, loudly saying this business will exist **only if** I am included. I know I look incredibly guilty.",
    "action": "Act distracted and highly focused on your finances. Question **Player 7 (The Legal Advisor)**, as you suspect he knows too much about your aggressive financial tactics.",
    "alibi": "I was checking the progress of an **online board meeting** when the lights went out.",
    "goal": "Ensure that the Momo King includes you in the deal as promised, or you will make sure the business is completely sunk.",
    "tips": "You have a history of using financial power for intimidation. Someone saw you threatening the Momo King recently, which makes you look very guilty.",
