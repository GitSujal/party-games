    "about": "I am **The Food Scientist**! 🧪 I spent months of my life working with the Momo King, analyzing ingredients, running tests, and perfecting the methodology for that uniform dough thickness he brags about. I thought we were partners, advancing culinary science! Then, the betrayal: he started making huge business plans and **registered patents** using my data without consulting me or giving me proper credit. 😠 I feel utterly used, as if my contributions were just disposable data points. He was only interested in making money, not valuing my expertise!",
    "secret": "I have advanced knowledge of chemical compounds and substances used in food preservation and poisoning—I know enough to do real damage and get away with it. Just before the party, I was actually in the kitchen testing the acidity of my *own* signature chutney, which means I was near the scene of the crime and any tampering. I am highly suspicious of **Player 10 (The Tech Guy)**, who I believe helped the Momo King hack into my research files.",
    "action": "Challenge anyone who discusses the poison, asking them to specify the chemical compound. Point fingers at someone who might have a bigger *emotional* motive than you.",
    "alibi": "You were in the bathroom washing chili off your hands (from testing your chutney) when the lights went out. This is a weak alibi.",
    "goal": "Expose the Momo King's unethical business practices and ensure he does not profit from the recipe without publicly acknowledging your work.",
    "tips": "You must save yourself by pointing fingers at someone who might have a bigger emotional motive than you. Your knowledge of chemicals makes you highly suspicious.",
