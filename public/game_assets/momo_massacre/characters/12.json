    "description": "Wife of P1, Killer.",
    "about": "I am **The Momo King's Wife**. 😭 After my husband started working on this ridiculous 'Best Momo of all Time' recipe, he became distant, obsessed, and cruel. Our marriage was destroyed by his ego. But the final, agonizing betrayal? With all the time he is away I think he is having external affairs. We have struggled this long together and when things are getting good he might leave me for someone else to enjoy this fortune with. I can't let that happen.",
    "secret": "**I AM THE KILLER.** I poisoned the Momo King with a powerful sedative that I stole from a friend's medicine cabinet, applying it to his Momo during the brief power blackout. My motive is pure, personal vengeance. My husband was not just cheating; he was humiliating me. I must find a way to make everyone believe that either **The Rival Chef** or **The Rival Chef's Wife** did this for the business, or to protect their own marriage.",
    "action": "**During Investigation:** Act dramatically and emotionally! Yell, cry, and confront suspects directly. Say things like, *'Did you kill my husband for the money? Did you kill him for his recipe?'* Be as theatrical as possible to divert attention from your true motive and actions.\n\n**Your Flaw:** Someone saw you go to the kitchen right before the lights went out, which contradicts the 'grieving widow' persona. If this comes up, deflect instantly!",
    "alibi": "Kitchen right before lights went out (suspicious).",
    "goal": "Kill your husband and divert all suspicion toward **The Rival Chef** and **The Rival Chef's Wife**. You must appear heartbroken and innocent.",
    "tips": "READ THE 'ABOUT', 'SECRET', AND 'ACTIONS' SECTIONS TWICE. YOU ARE THE KILLER.",
