    "about": "I am **The Rival Chef's Wife**! My husband (Player 3) was completely betrayed by the Momo King. The Momo King took everything he learned from my husband—all those shared secrets—and is now launching a massive business that will earn millions, while cutting my family out! I feel this is a betrayal not just of my husband, but of *our entire family's* future. I am furious! I even called the Momo King this morning and **threatened him** to give my husband his rightful share, or I would make sure he paid for it!",
