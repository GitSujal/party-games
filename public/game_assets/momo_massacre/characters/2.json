    "about": "I am **The Nepali Food Fanatic**! 🇳🇵 I refuse to eat anything that isn't authentic Nepali cuisine. Seriously, I think no other cuisine on this planet can compare to the rich flavors and spices of our food. I add spices to *everything* I eat—yes, even desserts—because **Timur** makes life better! I get genuinely upset when someone calls a Momo a 'Momos' **(it's always momo!)** or tries to fuse it with anything. The Momo King's talk of fusion and AI makes my blood boil. I am determined to make sure this 'Best Momo of all Time' recipe stays true to its roots and isn't polluted by modern nonsense! I think **The Rival Chef** only cares about money, not genuine flavor.",
    "secret": "Before the momo was served, I added a massive, extra-spicy pinch of my personal **Timur** stash to the Momo King's plate, hoping to enhance the flavor and 'correct' his poor taste. This was **before** the poisoning. I have to be extremely careful, because someone saw me do this, and if they accuse me, I will look guilty of adding the final, fatal ingredient.",
    "action": "When questioned about the poison, loudly announce that the poison must have been a non-traditional ingredient. Defend your use of Timur as a 'flavor correction,' not an attempt to harm.",
    "alibi": "Helping host prepare momos (weak alibi).",
    "goal": "Find out who poisoned the Momo King and ensure they are punished. You must publicly shame the Momo King's 'fusion' attempts to protect authentic Nepali cuisine.",
    "tips": "**Your Flaws:**\n- You did threaten to confront the Momo King about his fusion ideas earlier in the evening, which could make you look suspicious.\n- You did add something to his food and there are people who saw you do it, which could make you look guilty.",
