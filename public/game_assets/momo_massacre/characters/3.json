    "description": "Former mentor of the Momo King who feels betrayed and overshadowed by his protégé's success.",
    "about": "I am **The Rival Chef**! I was the one who helped the Momo King get started in the culinary world when he first arrived. We used to spend hours chatting about how to achieve the perfect Momo. But as the years went by, I felt overshadowed by his talent and fame. 😠 I always believed *I* could create a better recipe, and I feel like he took all my best tips and claimed them as his own! Now he's launching this 'Best Momo' business, and I see it as a chance to finally take him down. I'm furious because I know the success he's celebrating is half mine, and he's cut me out completely.",
    "secret": "I was secretly planning to launch my own competitive Momo business and saw the Momo King's plans as an immediate threat. I was preparing to send him a formal **cease-and-desist** letter based on the intellectual property he stole from me. Furthermore, my wife, **Player 11**, is highly suspicious that *I* am having an affair with **Player 12 (The Momo King's Wife)**, which is why she is so angry. This personal drama makes my wife protective of me but also very volatile.",
    "action": "When the murder is announced, look stressed. Casually mention that you were talking to your lawyer about 'intellectual property matters' when the lights went out. Keep the topic vague to avoid incriminating yourself, but let the lawyer alibi hang in the air.",
    "alibi": "Talking to lawyer on phone about 'intellectual property matters'.",
    "goal": "Sabotage the Momo King's plans and ensure that your own superior Momo recipe becomes the most popular in town.",
    "tips": "Your wife (Player 11) is very protective of you but also suspects you of having an affair. This creates additional tension and drama.",
